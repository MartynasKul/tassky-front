# tassky-front
To test socket functionality (that is slightly outdated at this point of project, will need to update), will need to uncomment ws code section and add this to your .env file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=yourBackendWebsocketUrl;
```

To run in development mode be sure to have backend running or just hope that my backend is running on vercel.
```
#to run in localhost:
cd tassky-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
