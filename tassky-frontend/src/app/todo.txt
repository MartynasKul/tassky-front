Things that i would like to do to move this project further:
- Move all types and interfaces to types.ts file
- Move auth to Clerk instead of writing the auth myself. As proven with no Google OAuth, im incapable of doing that for now. Thats why a normal, less secure JWT auth is done.
- Move to AWS instead of Vercel. (unless i figure out websockets with vercel)
- Add API for task creation from other tools such as github, machines that run certain tasks.
- Add AI bot to create tasks with natural language instead of going and manually adding the tasks myself.
- Make my project more swift and mobile friendly. (Currently not that mobile friendly as seen from some modals/pages)
